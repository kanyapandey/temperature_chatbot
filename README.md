These are the very first thing which you guys have to keep in mind after downloading the code:

    1) Before using this code, first install all npm modules (npm install)
    2) In config.js file replace all necessary informations related to facebook developer account
    3) In dialogflow, make the intents and add training phrases accordingly
    4) If you send simple text "send-temperature" then make sure that your intent name and action parameter is also the same    (i.e. send-temperature)
    5) In Facebook messenger you will be able to see the response like this : "It's 79.72 degrees in Bangkok!"
    
Enjoy and happy coding !!!
